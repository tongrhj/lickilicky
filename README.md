# lickilicky

Easy to reference list of merchants offering 1-for-1 F&B deals in Singapore

Will allow for tracking over time in case merchants are added/removed without informing subscribers (rude!)

Magic happens during `npm run build`:

- Copies relevant frontend files to `dist` folder
- Retrieves the latest merchant data and compares it with the existing data to build the diff
- Generates its output as `dist/venues.min.json` for frontend (`index.html`) to consume
- Sends a notification to Telegram with the diff formatted for chat

CircleCI is scheduled to run every weekday, 9am SGT
