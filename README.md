Easy to reference list of merchants offering 1-for-1 F&B deals in Singapore

Will allow for tracking over time in case merchants are added/removed without informing subscribers (rude!)

`npm run build` retrieves the latest merchant data and compares it with the existing merchant data to build the diff

CircleCI is scheduled to run every weekday, 6:30pm SGT
